# This is a jupyter notebook repository

This repository was created with the purpose of recording my progress along various machine learning fields
Every dataset used will be availble by files or comands using the Kaggle API inside the dataset

This is a virtual environment, so the requirements.txt contains all packages that I used along the notebooks
